## Environment

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

## Cleaning statistics
```{bash}
DIRECT=~/Box/LukeLab/UnderstandingTheProcessOfReading/data
DATA=${DIRECT}/cleaning\ -\ UPoR1.txt # file with cleaning stats

mv $DATA ${DIRECT}/cleaning-UPoR1.txt
DATA=${DIRECT}/cleaning-UPoR1.txt

MERGED=${tail -2 cleaning-UPoR1.txt} # read in last two lines
```

```{r}
MERGED <- 738
DELETED <- 9985
DIR <- file.path("~","Box","LukeLab","UnderstandingTheProcessOfReading","data") # study directory
FIXS <- read.table(file.path(DIR,"FixList.xls"), header = TRUE, sep = "\t") # list of fixations
TOTAL <- as.numeric(count(FIXS)) # count total number of fixation events
REMAIN <- (MERGED + DELETED) / TOTAL
REMAIN*100 # percent of fixations that were excluded or merged.
```

## Data

Here are the paths to the data. Let's bring them together along common variables.

```{r}
REPORT <- read.table(file.path(DIR,"IA_report_UPoR1.txt"), header = TRUE, sep = "\t", fill = TRUE) # interest areas report
ORTHOS <- read.table(file.path(DIR,"Provo_Corpus-Eyetracking_Data.csv"), header = TRUE, sep = ",", fill = TRUE) # ortho probabilities

COMBINED <- REPORT %>%
  left_join(ORTHOS, by = c("IA_ID" = "IA_ID", "IA_LABEL" = "IA_LABEL"))
```
